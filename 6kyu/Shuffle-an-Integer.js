Shuffle an Integer

Description:
Write a function that returns a "shuffled" version of an integer...
Shuffle?

             (    puzzle!    )

...with your method deduced from the rules, examples, and tests.
Input

A non-zero positive integer n.
Output

A different non-negative integer,
        being a fair random choice of one of the possible shufflings of the given input n
                (if any exist),
        otherwise 0.
Singularity

    An integer cannot shuffle into itself.

Duality

    Some pairs of integers can shuffle from one into the other interchangeably.
    Other pairs can only shuffle from one of the numbers into the other number.

Multiplicity

    integers can generally be shuffled in multiple ways
    possibly an integer could be shuffled only one way
    for shuffling some integers there are no ways at all

Functionality

As opposed to simply returning any valid shuffled version of an integer,
the function must evenly return all possible outputs for the given input
with approximate equal frequency at a minimum confidence of 97.5%.
Examples

    1 cannot be shuffled
    2 can only be shuffled into 1
    3 cannot be shuffled
    4 can be shuffled into 1 or 2
    5 can be shuffled into 3 or 6
    6 can be shuffled into 3 or 5
    7 cannot be shuffled
    8 can be shuffled into 1, 2, or 4
    9 can be shuffled into 3, 5, 6, 10, or 12

*/

// Solution
// convert integer to binary, Randomly generate one valid shuffle until it doesn't equal n
function shuffint(n) {
	const bin = n.toString(2);
	const k = bin.length;
	const ones = [...bin].filter((b) => b === '1').length;

	if (ones === 0 || ones === k || k === 1) return 0;

	while (true) {
		let bits = Array(k).fill(0);
		let remaining = ones;

		for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
			if (remaining === 0) break;
			if (Math.random() < remaining / (k - i)) {
				bits[i] = 1;
				remaining--;
			}
		}

		const value = parseInt(bits.join(''), 2);
		if (value !== n) return value;
	}
}

// Test Codes
const tester = (input, expected) => {
	const actual = shuffint(input);
	if (expected.includes(actual)) {
		console.log('✅ PASSED');
	} else {
		console.log('❌ FAILED:', actual);
	}
};

	[1, [0]], //  no ways at all
	[2, [1]], //  only one way
	[3, [0]], //  no ways at all
	[4, [1, 2]], //  multiple ways
	[5, [3, 6]], //  multiple ways
	[6, [3, 5]], //  multiple ways
	[7, [0]], //  no ways at all
	[8, [1, 2, 4]], //  multiple ways
	[9, [3, 5, 6, 10, 12]], //  multiple ways
];
for (const [number, expected] of examples) {
	tester(number, expected);
}

	15, 23, 27, 29, 30, 39, 43, 45, 46, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 71, 75, 77, 78,
